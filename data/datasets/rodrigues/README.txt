Additional Notes on File Relationships, Context, or Content 
(for example, if a user wants to reuse and/or cite your data, 
what information would you want them to know?): 

The data contained in this CSV was simultaneously collected during 209 flight campaigns from the following on-board sensors: Wind sensor: FT Technologies FT205 UAV-mountable, pre-calibrated ultrasonic wind sensor with accuracy of ± 0.1 m/s and refresh rate of 10 Hz; Position: 3DM-GX5-45 GNSS/INS sensor pack. These sensors use a built-in Kalman filtering system to fuse the GPS and IMU data. The sensor has a maximum output rate of 10Hz with accuracy of ± 2 m$ RMS horizontal, ± 5 m$ RMS vertical; Current and Voltage: Mauch Electronics PL-200 sensor. This sensor can record currents up to 200 A and voltages up to 33 V. Analogue readings from the sensor were converted into a digital format using an 8 channel 17 bit analogue-to-digital converter (ADC). Data syncing and recording was handled using the Robot Operating System (ROS) running on a low-power Raspberry Pi Zero W. Data was recorded on the Raspberry Pi's microSD card. The data provided by each sensor were synchronized to a frequency of approximately 5Hz using the ApproximateTime message filter policy of Robot Operating System (ROS).

raw_files.zip was added on 20200921 and correspond to version 2 of the record.
The raw files are v2.0 ROSBag files with .bag extensions.
Each .bag has data from 4 topics as lists below:

anemometer
This topic is of the type anemometer/Anemometer. This a custom message type to record info from the anemometer. The topic is published by the anememeter ROS driver. The details in the ROS message are:
```
speed: Magnitude of wind as measured by the anemometer (m/s)
angle: Magnetic angle of wind as measured by the anemometer 
```
To see the message please install the msg topic from the  anemometer code repo.
battery
This topic is of the type sensor_msgs/BatteryState. This is a standard meassage in ROS. The topic is published by the ADC driver in ROS. We populate the following fields:
```

voltage: Voltage in Volts
current: Negative when discharging (A)  
```
imu/data
This topic is of the type sensor_msgs/Imu. This is a standard meassage in ROS. The topic is published by the  microstrain_3dm_gx5_45 driver in ROS.
nav/odom

This topic is of the type nav_msgs/Odometry. This is a standard meassage in ROS. The topic is published by the  microstrain_3dm_gx5_45 driver in ROS.

<create sections for each dataset included>


1. Number of variables: 7


2. Number of cases/rows: 209 


3. Missing data codes: The dataset has no missing data, but in the case of missing codes, the dataset would use "NA" to denote missing data.


4. Variable List

    A. Name: flight
       Description: an integer that represents the code of the flight performed. A flight is defined as the data set recorded from the take-off to landing in a predefined route.

    B. Name: speed
       Description: programmed horizontal ground speed during cruise in meters per second (m/s).

    C. Name: payload
       Description: mass of the payload attached to aircraft in grams (g). The payload used was confined in a standard USPS Small Flat Rate Box.

    D. Name: altitude
       Description: predefined altitude in meters (m). The aircraft takes off vertically until it reaches the preset altitude.

    E. Name: date
       Description: when the flight was conducted in the YYYY-MM-DD format

    F. Name: local_time
       Description: local time when the flight started in the 24:00-hour format.

    G. Name: route
       Description: A predefined path followed by the aircraft. Routes R1 to R7 indicate flights where the drone completed a cruise movement. The differences among routes R1 to R7 reflect variations on the starting point or variations on the altitude during cruise. The differences among routes can be assessed by plotting variables position_x, position_y and position_z. Routes A refer to ancillary ground tests where the drone remained on the ground and did not take off. Route A1 refers to a test with the drone running with no propellers and no motor movement; Route A2 to a test with the drone running with no propellers and minimum motor movement; and Route A3 to a test with the drone running with propellers and minimum motor movement. Route H refers to a test with the drone hovering with no horizonal movement. In summary:   
	R1 to R7 = full flights completing a cruise movement;
	A1 = Ancillary ground test with no propellers and no motor movement;
	A2 = Ancillary ground test with no propellers and minimum movement; 
	A3 = Ancillary ground test with propellers and minimum movement;
	H = Hover test with no horizontal movement.

    O. Name: payload
       Description: mass of the payload attached to aircraft in grams (g). The payload used was confined in a standard USPS Small Flat Rate Box.

    P. Name: altitude
       Description: predefined altitude in meters (m). The aircraft takes off vertically until it reaches the preset altitude.

    Q. Name: date
       Description: when the flight was conducted in the YYYY-MM-DD format

    R. Name: local_time
       Description: local time when the flight started in the 24:00-hour format.

    S. Name: route
       Description: A predefined path followed by the aircraft. Routes R1 to R7 indicate flights where the drone completed a cruise movement. The differences among routes R1 to R7 reflect variations on the starting point or variations on the altitude during cruise. The differences among routes can be assessed by plotting variables position_x, position_y and position_z. Routes A refer to ancillary ground tests where the drone remained on the ground and did not take off. Route A1 refers to a test with the drone running with no propellers and no motor movement; Route A2 to a test with the drone running with no propellers and minimum motor movement; and Route A3 to a test with the drone running with propellers and minimum motor movement. Route H refers to a test with the drone hovering with no horizonal movement. In summary:   
	R1 to R7 = full flights completing a cruise movement;
	A1 = Ancillary ground test with no propellers and no motor movement;
	A2 = Ancillary ground test with no propellers and minimum movement; 
	A3 = Ancillary ground test with propellers and minimum movement;
	H = Hover test with no horizontal movement.

Manufacturer: Mauch Electronics
Model: PL-200 sensor

(if applicable)
Embedded Software / Firmware Name: N/A
Embedded Software / Firmware Version: N/A
Additional Notes: This sensor is based on the Allegra ACS758-200U hall current sensor, and can record currents up to 200A and voltages up to 33V. The sensor board is only installed into the "positive" (red) main wire from the LiPo; the "negative "black" wire stays untouched, which reduces the risk the sensor board might short circuit. Analogue readings from the sensor are converted into a digital format using a 8 channel 17 bit analogue-to-digital converter (ADC). The ADC is based on the MCP3424 from Microchip Technologies Inc and is a delta-sigma A/D converter with low noise differential inputs.
